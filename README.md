# Crypto Keys SDK

## Introduction

Welcome to the Crypto Keys SDK. This SDK allows you to import, create and work with symmetric and asymmetric keys and certificates to sign/verify digest values, encrypt/decrypt input, or hash and sign input values. The benefit is that you don't have to store secret keys in your application. The API has an integration with Azure KeyVault, allowing you to store keys, secrets and certificates in FIPS 140-2 Level 2 validated Hardware Security Modules (HSM). The key will never leave the HSM, making it really secure, especially if you combine it with IP whitelisting
